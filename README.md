# school-timetable-assignment
## Project Overview
This is a simple HTML and CSS project representing a weekly school timetable. The project was created as part of a web design assignment to demonstrate basic layout structuring using semantic HTML and styling with CSS.

## Features
- Displays a weekly schedule from Monday to Friday.
- Clearly segmented time slots.
- Styled using a custom CSS file for readability and visual appeal.
- Organized layout that works across desktop screen sizes.

## Accessibility Considerations
- Used semantic HTML elements like `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<caption>`.
- Included clear table headers and structured content for screen reader compatibility.
- Ensured sufficient contrast between text and background for readability.
- Fonts and padding were chosen to make content legible without zooming.
